# Aviator Betting Bot

The Aviator Betting Bot is an automation tool designed to monitor and place bets on the Aviator game automatically. Built using Node.js, TensorFlow, Puppeteer, and other powerful libraries, the bot can streamline the betting process by analyzing data patterns and placing bets based on specified conditions. The goal is to optimize your betting strategy by leveraging automation and data-driven insights.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jackjavi/Aviator-Automated-Bot.git
    cd aviator-bot
    ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## How to Run
The bot can be executed in different modes depending on your use case:

1. **Start the bot with default settings**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   This command will run the script defined in `mozzart.js`.

2. **Run in development mode** (uses `index.js`):
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

3. Make sure you have your login credentials and necessary configurations (such as the betting strategy) set in the relevant files before running the bot.

4. **Python Script**: If you want to utilize the prediction model or any AI functionality, ensure `predict.py` is properly configured. Run:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

## How It Works
The bot operates in a series of steps as outlined below:

1. **Authentication**: Logs into the betting site using provided credentials.
2. **Navigation**: Once logged in, it navigates to the Aviator game page.
3. **Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors the Aviator values displayed on the page, updating every 4 seconds.
4. **Analysis & Decision Making**: It analyzes the latest win values and decides whether to place a bet based on predefined conditions.
5. **Betting**: If the conditions are met, the bot places a bet.
6. **Loop**: The bot repeats the monitoring and betting process, providing real-time feedback and data logging.

> **Note**: The monitoring and betting process will continue indefinitely. To stop the bot, you will need to manually interrupt the script execution using `CTRL + C` in your terminal.

## Key Features
- **Automated Login and Navigation**: Handles login and game navigation with Puppeteer.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors and updates the Aviator values every few seconds.
- **Customizable Betting Conditions**: Specify the conditions for placing bets, making it flexible to adapt to various strategies.
- **Data Analysis**: Uses TensorFlow and statistical models to predict optimal betting strategies.
- **Graphical Visualizations**: Displays trends and historical betting data using Chart.js.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Can interact via web sockets using `socket.io` for dynamic updates.

## Future Enhancements
In future versions of the Aviator Betting Bot, we plan to introduce the following enhancements:

1. **Auto-stopping of Bets After Loss Streaks**: Automatically stops placing bets if a predefined number of consecutive losses is reached.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualization of betting data using interactive charts and graphs for better understanding of trends and patterns.
3. **Real-time Notifications**: Send real-time notifications (via email, SMS, or other messaging platforms) whenever a bet is placed.
4. **Improved Accuracy in Predictions**: Integration of machine learning algorithms and statistical models to improve the bot's decision-making process.
5. **Customizable Betting Strategies**: Define your own betting strategies based on specific criteria, allowing for a more personalized betting experience.
